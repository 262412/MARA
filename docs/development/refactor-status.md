# MARA refactor status — 2026-09-10

## Current round: review of 7496c6ae

**The user-listed R0 gates passed. R1 is complete and its applicable gates passed.**
The R1 source is `c693160e6e5f0e6c05edd8d507219679aad120d2`, normally pushed to
`origin/codex/r0-r1-safe-refactor`; local and remote HEAD were verified equal at
that source push.
[Quality gates 34445819877, attempt 1](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/34445819877)
was dispatched once for that SHA with the explicit original Dev base. It is
complete with overall **failure**: six NLTK audit jobs failed, so the required
aggregate also failed. All full suites, static/hygiene, packaging, security
smoke/secret scans and coverage gates passed. No R2 work has started.

The final report-only commit does not change the validated Python or workflow
source and is not dispatched again. `evidence-summary-final.json` records the
actual final local/remote HEAD, the validated source SHA and the report-only
delta. The workflow as a whole remains NO-GO because of the six audit failures.

The accepted R0 source is
`8cc9e9403b92f87b15db82b000c24c65c47b84db`, pushed normally to
`origin/codex/r0-r1-safe-refactor`. Its full Ubuntu validation completed as
[Quality gates 34440810480, attempt 1](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/34440810480),
with original Dev `base_ref=adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a`.
The overall workflow conclusion is **failure** because the NLTK dependency/
container audits failed and the image secret scan timed out. All R0-source
full suites, static/hygiene checks, package coverage floors, exports and the
90% production diff gate passed. The R1 entry conditions are recorded separately
from that overall workflow conclusion.

This round explicitly permits small commits, normal same-branch pushes and the
existing workflow dispatch. The historical statements below about an unpushed
follow-up or remote `89d99551` describe the earlier authorization boundary;
they are no longer current blockers. No new branch/worktree, history rewrite,
force push, merge, release, key change, WSL installation or local environment
synchronization has been performed. The pre-existing untracked `NUL` remains.

### Changes and affected surfaces

The affected surfaces are startup resource/config selection, test-owned
filesystem/storage lifecycle, shared file selection imports and CI coverage
artifacts. Public CLI names and options, database formats,
DocQA routing, prompts, UI event chains and production deadline budgets are
unchanged. The earlier deadline/cancellation fixes remain in history.

- `6eab0f90`: treat `NLTK_DATA` as an ordered search list. Ordinary startup does
  not prepare resource directories; test mode validates every nonempty entry
  and prepares only its first owned directory. Empty test lists select the
  owned cache. Configuration discovery and explicit loading validate the
  resolved file before reading/executing it, then validate returned storage/DB
  paths. Owned module names resolve without executing unchecked parent
  packages. A small initial settings bridge lets TheFlow validate the actual
  custom settings before creating its global storage instance.
- `857d70d0`: validate session ownership before accepting pytest basetemp.
  Reject the session root, aliases, outside directories and overlap with
  config/cache/data/output/temp state. Tests invoke pytest's real basetemp
  clearing and verify the owner marker and state sentinels survive.
- `ea406f8e`: the fixtures that create Chroma stores also stop their owned
  Chroma systems before session cleanup. They remove only matching owned
  registry entries. Tests delete the released native-index directory and
  continue writing through another live instance. A fresh pytest child must
  return zero and remove its session directory after unconfigure.
- `0b8f18c7`: give app-init hardening fixtures their own complete runtime and
  seed the config directory actually used by the CLI. The old fixture inherited
  the parent test root while checking a different config directory.
- `331f9c8e`: read the Windows-specific error code with `getattr` in the two
  new symlink test helpers. The intermediate Ubuntu static job exposed that
  Linux mypy does not define `OSError.winerror`; this is a test portability
  correction and does not weaken the native symlink assertions.
- `cd12795d`: exclude pytest-owned `session-*` fixtures from coverage collection
  and exports under the configured runtime parent (or the existing default).
  A deleted test `flowsettings.py` had the same module name as a root production
  file, so XML export attempted to read it after successful session cleanup.
  Synthetic-data regressions reproduce the original export error, retain all
  four production packages and four root files in XML/JSON, retain uncovered
  statements, and still fail if real production source is missing. No coverage
  collector is started by these local export regressions.
- `8cc9e940`: merge package-relative subprocess coverage paths into their
  canonical repository files before reporting. Six independent cases cover
  all three library packages and both slash styles; they require measurements
  from both paths to survive, one missing line to remain missing, and valid
  XML/JSON. The existing artifact upload now retains hidden coverage data for
  diagnosis. Tests finalize their own Coverage instance, including mapped
  SQLite copies retained internally by its reporting API.
- `26d8e873`: commit 140 fixed-expectation characterization cases before moving
  either production function. Both old import paths, class static methods,
  actual patch consumers, graph composition and DocQA artifact scope are tested.
- `c693160e`: move only `normalize_selected_file_ids` and
  `merge_unique_file_ids` into `ktem_contracts/file_selection.py`. Both old
  modules bind those same function objects under the existing names; all other
  selection/UI logic and the class wrappers remain unchanged. Include
  `ktem_contracts` in the existing ktem coverage floor and production diff gate,
  and verify the new module in built wheels/sdists and clean wheel smoke imports.

The before-fix independent boundary run failed 20 cases. Separate regressions
also reproduced the app fixture mismatch and rejection of an owned benchmark
module name. The real Chroma child previously passed its assertion but exited
nonzero during cleanup with a locked HNSW file. All original assertions were
retained. During repair, a real custom-storage check caught an intermediate
initialization-order error; the final bridge preserves agreement between the
selected settings and the actual storage instance, including a fresh child.

### Local evidence for the pushed source

Evidence is retained outside Git under
`D:\PythonProject\MARA-refactor-review-20260910-01a086ff\next-round`.
`execution.jsonl` records commands, source hashes, cwd, timestamps and exit
codes; failed attempts remain separate from final results.

The 02:49 UTC snapshot preceded this round's tests. At 07:27 UTC, after the R1
local tests, artifact checks and report verification, the canonical
environment still had the same 98,823 entries and identical metadata hash;
the retained user cache had the same 614 entries and identical metadata hash.
Known profile config/SQLite and repository SQLite size/mtime records are also
identical. See `preserved-before.json` and `preserved-final.json`.
The final 19-test coverage regression run exits zero and removes its own runtime
directory. Two directories from earlier failed synthetic-data tests remain:
`D:\MARA-next-pytest-01a086ff\session-_tt6h466` and
`D:\MARA-next-pytest-01a086ff\session-n97o375r`. Those attempts exposed retained
SQLite handles before the instance cleanup was fixed. Automatic approval
rejected the subsequent recursive cleanup command with `blocked by policy`.
A narrower plan enumerated and hashed 80 regular files (587,882 bytes) and 98
directories, checked that no reparse points existed, and proposed deleting only
those files followed by nonrecursive deletion of empty directories. Automatic
approval rejected that plan too with the same reason; neither cleanup command
ran. No further deletion was attempted. The exact remaining files are recorded
in `runtime-inventory-after-coverage-paths.json` and
`owned-coverage-orphans-manifest.json`.
The post-R1 read-only inventory in `runtime-inventory-after-r1.json` confirms
only those two older directories remain. No `subcover*.pth` files exist.
These are metadata comparisons, not a recovery of the original pre-incident
configuration. The historical real-user configuration/cache incidents and
after-event copies documented below remain part of the record.

No local full coverage was rerun. Subprocess coverage remains enabled in the
Ubuntu workflow, and all four package floors plus the 90% production
diff floor remain required. No dependency or audit/hygiene baseline was changed.

### Ubuntu evidence and R1 decision

The review input `7496c6ae5b7823174cff3e7cc9ea318c0a841fb0` had no existing
Quality gates run, so it was dispatched once with the explicit branch/base.
[Run 34430620710, attempt 1](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/34430620710)
completed with **failure** at that exact SHA. Its ktem suite passed 2,644 tests;
both kotaemon versions failed the one config-symlink fixture assertion. Root/
benchmark and coverage each failed four benchmark runtime module-selection
cases. The failures were read before applying the targeted repairs above.

All three dependency profiles rejected nine NLTK 3.10.0 advisory IDs, and all
three container profiles rejected seven NLTK CVE findings. Raw job logs and
the complete job/run JSON are retained as `ci-34430620710-job-*.log` and
`quality-34430620710-*.json`; exact IDs remain in those logs. These are the
scanner findings from the actual run, not a separate exploitability assessment.
Upgrading dependencies or suppressing findings is not authorized in this round.

The intermediate run `34432962143`, attempt 1, tested
`0b8f18c7175c23d3aac23ee9fa621561f1ba86aa`. Both kotaemon versions passed
371 tests / 10 optional dependency skips, including the real config symlink
tests. Static analysis failed only on the two new `OSError.winerror` accesses.
The portable correction passed Linux-targeted mypy using the existing cached
hook environment and the local 33-test boundary suite (10 native symlink
skips). See `portable-symlink-cached-mypy-linux.log`,
`portable-symlink-precommit.log`, `portable-symlink-regressions.log` and
`push-portable-symlinks.log`. The push succeeded; its first follow-up direct
remote query timed out. A read-only query through the existing proxy verified
the new remote SHA without changing Git configuration.

Run `34433661997`, attempt 1, tested `331f9c8ef67012653be81fd2d7daad75288912eb`;
`dispatch-331f9c8e.json` and `quality-runs-331f9c8e-started.json` record dispatch
and run identity. The existing workflow concurrency policy replaced the
intermediate run, whose final conclusion is **cancelled**; unfinished gates
from that run are not counted as passes.
It completed with **failure**. The completed jobs at that revision have these
results; they are not presented as the subsequent source's completed CI:

The raw logs for that source use `ci-34433661997-job-*.log`; job snapshots
use `quality-34433661997-jobs-*.json`.
`dependency-audit-findings-331f9c8e.json` retains all nine GHSA and seven CVE
IDs, their exact log lines and the six affected jobs. The two scanner ID
namespaces are not added together as a distinct vulnerability count.
The coverage-instrumented test suites also passed before export: root/benchmark
1,609; kotaemon 371 plus 10 skips; ktem 2,644; and slide_cli's complete passing
progress output. The failure was `No source for code` for a removed test-session
`flowsettings.py`, not a package threshold violation. The uploaded coverage
artifact `10136434812` is only 336 bytes. Downloading and inspecting the ZIP
confirmed that it contains only `coverage.ini`; upload success is not accepted
as valid XML/JSON output. See
`coverage-export-failure-331f9c8e.json` and job `102734405186`'s raw log.

The targeted export repair was committed and pushed as `cd12795d`. Its 13 local
quality-script tests pass, using synthetic data without starting a coverage
collector or installing `.pth` files. Changed-file hooks, the exact existing CI
Ruff command, hygiene and the original-Dev baseline comparison also pass. The
first broader Ruff invocation omitted the workflow's pre-existing exclusions
and reported two existing `.pyi` issues; those files and exclusions were not
changed. See `coverage-export-tests-verified.log`,
`coverage-export-hooks-verified.log`, `coverage-export-ci-ruff.log`,
`coverage-export-hygiene.log`, `coverage-export-baseline.log` and

No dependency or audit baseline was changed. `dependency-audit-findings-cd12795d.json`
records the exact findings and raw log lines for all six audit jobs at that SHA.
Raw logs and final snapshots use `ci-34437287461-job-*.log` and
`quality-34437287461-*.json`. All instrumented suites passed before export:
root/benchmark 1,611; kotaemon 371 plus 10 skips; ktem 2,644; slide_cli passed.
The path error came from package-directory subprocess measurements, and the
downloaded artifact `10137660368` again contained only `coverage.ini`. Its SHA256
matches GitHub's artifact digest; see `coverage-artifact-cd12795d-inspection.json`.

The path-mapping correction passed `coverage-paths-tests-verified.log` (19 tests,
exit zero including unconfigure), `coverage-paths-hooks-verified.log`,
`coverage-paths-ci-ruff.log`, `coverage-paths-hygiene.log` and
`coverage-paths-baseline.log`. Its before-fix six-case failure and intermediate
cleanup failures remain in the evidence directory; see
`command-remediation-coverage-paths.json`. Normal push of `8cc9e940` is verified
in `push-8cc9e940-normalized.json`.

[Run 34440810480, attempt 1](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/34440810480)

All completed jobs' raw logs are retained as `ci-34440810480-job-*.log`, plus
`ci-34440810480-aggregate.log`.
`dependency-audit-findings-8cc9e940.json` records the six NLTK audit failures.
The image secret job built the image successfully, then failed inside Trivy
while acquiring its analysis semaphore (`context deadline exceeded`). It did
not produce a completed secret-scan verdict; this is neither a clean scan nor
a secret-detection finding. See `image-secret-scan-timeout-8cc9e940.json` and
job `102755280292`'s complete log. No scanner timeout, scope or failure policy
was changed, and no unchanged-source rerun was dispatched.

Coverage artifact `10138960793` was downloaded and its SHA256 matched the GitHub
digest. It contains `.coverage`, `coverage.ini`, valid XML and valid JSON. The
996 raw file records have no remaining package-relative aliases, and no removed
test-runtime files appear in the JSON. Artifact-derived package totals match the
job log. See `coverage-artifact-8cc9e940/inspection.json` and
`quality-34440810480-final.json` / `quality-34440810480-jobs-final.json`.

The user-listed isolation, lifecycle, current full-suite, static and coverage
conditions for R1 are now verified at `8cc9e940`. R1 began with 140 fixed-expectation
tests against the untouched old implementations, including the two module
paths, both classes' static methods, real patch consumers and graph/DocQA
callers. That run exited zero, including unconfigure; see
`r1-characterization-old-implementation.log` and the formatted, committed
`r1-characterization-old-verified.log`. No R1 production change preceded those
passing old-implementation tests.

### R1 implementation and current-source validation

The extraction retains duplicates, whitespace, zero/False, tuple conversion,
ordering and exception propagation. Old module imports expose the shared
function objects with their original signatures; existing static methods and
their real module-global patch lookups are unchanged. The two selector
extraction implementations, UI selector, `chat_submit_sources`, routes,
prompts and persisted representations are unchanged. `r1-ast-equivalence.log`
compares the two shared function ASTs against both originals at `8cc9e940`,
checks all other top-level code in those modules, and verifies the DocQA/chat
consumer files are unchanged.

The current source passed these local gates, including process exit and pytest
unconfigure, using the existing environment without synchronization:

- `r1-caller-contracts-verified.log`: 214 passed, including 142 extraction
  contracts and the existing DocQA, chat, graph and CLI caller checks.
- `r1-boundaries-packaging-verified.log`: 37 passed. The isolated `python -I -B`
  cold-import probe rejects runtime/UI imports and writes nothing in its fake
  working directory. Four distribution builds verify legal metadata as before;
  the actual ktem wheel and sdist must include `file_selection.py`.
- `r1-extraction-hooks-verified.log`, `r1-ci-ruff.log`, `r1-hygiene.log` and
  `r1-hygiene-baseline.log`: all exit zero; original Dev comparison is unchanged.

The coverage policy previously did not count `ktem_contracts`. An independent
negative case showed a changed statement there being ignored (0/0). The shared
module is now collected and counted in ktem's existing 50% floor and the same
90% production diff gate. Synthetic XML/JSON tests retain uncovered statements,
and path-combine tests now cover this fourth library root too. No local coverage
collector was started; the tests explicitly reject `Coverage.start`.

`dependency-audit-findings-c693160e.json` records the actual six failing jobs
and confirms the GHSA/CVE identifier sets are identical to R0. The image
secret scan completed successfully on this SHA; its earlier timeout is not
reported as a current failure. These are scanner findings, not an exploitability
assessment. No dependency upgrade or audit suppression was made.

The instrumented suites also completed successfully: root/benchmark 1,622;
kotaemon 371 plus 10 skips; ktem 2,786; and the complete slide_cli run. Raw logs
for all 20 jobs are retained as `ci-34445819877-job-*.log`. The aggregate job
`102782491452` records success for every required group except dependency and
container audits. Final run/job metadata are in `quality-34445819877-final.json`
and `quality-34445819877-jobs-final.json`.

[Coverage artifact 10141027869](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/34445819877/artifacts/10141027869)
was downloaded and inspected. Its 623,616-byte ZIP matches GitHub's SHA256
`c4159163cafb92b458a64a51b1ac13888487687fc75fd4d567d7e03afc808966`.
It contains the combined `.coverage` data, `coverage.ini`, valid XML and valid
JSON. Its 1,001 raw file records contain no package-relative aliases; no removed
test-runtime files appear in the JSON. Artifact-derived package totals match
the CI log. The new `ktem_contracts/file_selection.py` has 22/22 covered
statements and no exclusions or missing statements. Both shared functions have
100% statement coverage. See `coverage-artifact-c693160e/inspection.json`.
`r1-downloaded-diff-coverage.log` independently recomputes the same 94.82%
production diff from that JSON against original Dev, without starting coverage
collection locally.

R1's fixed old-behavior characterization, exact two-function extraction,
legacy import/signature/staticmethod/patch compatibility, real callers, cold
import, distribution membership and applicable current-source gates are now
verified. The remaining six NLTK audit failures keep the complete Quality gates
workflow red; dependency changes and baseline suppression remain outside this
round's authorization. The two historical test directories remain because
automatic approval rejected their cleanup, as recorded above.
No R2 work is included.

## Historical evidence through 7496c6ae

All sections below preserve the earlier review and follow-up record. Their
NO-GO, unstarted R1 and unpushed statements apply to those historical snapshots;
the current decision, source SHA and completed CI results are recorded above.

**R0 remains NO-GO; R1 has not started.** The follow-up below repairs test
isolation, deterministic deadline checks and two confirmed Windows path-boundary
defects. Current supported-platform package and coverage gates remain required.
Skipped POSIX tests and historical CI are not current passes. The five earlier
R0 commits, through `89d99551a028ff4948bb40f0a06bcc24d24822cb`, were pushed at the
user's explicit request before this follow-up. This follow-up permits local
commits only and performs no new push, branch/worktree creation, branch switch,
merge, history rewrite, environment synchronization or R1/R2 extraction.

  existing local `Dev` remains `bc8074d0f724a3a1005a2637f4a1e867f56d68de`.
- Initial tracked changes: none. The existing untracked `NUL` and other
  worktrees were preserved. Runtime data and the existing `.venv` were retained.
- Evidence directory (outside Git):
  `D:\PythonProject\MARA-refactor-review-20260910-01a086ff`.
  `execution.jsonl` records wrapper commands, cwd, exit codes, duration and log
  paths; the other named logs retain direct-command and baseline evidence.

The primary checkout has an existing Windows CPython 3.10.19 environment.
The POSIX canonical wrapper requires `bin/python` and HPC mount paths that
are absent here; WSL reported no installed distribution. Tests used
`uv run --no-sync --offline --python 3.10 python`, with the three current
workspace libraries on `PYTHONPATH`, existing cached pre-commit environments,
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, and a session `MARA_PYTEST_RUNTIME_PARENT` under
the evidence directory. No syncing/installing wrapper was substituted.
This is Windows source validation, not a claim of Ubuntu CI equivalence.

**Historical isolation exception from the original R0 full suite:** `PlatformDirs` on Windows
does not use the test's XDG cache override. `flowsettings.STORAGE["prefix"]`
resolved to the existing
`C:\Users\22826\AppData\Local\Cinnamon\Kotaemon\Cache\theflow`, outside the
session directory. Metadata inspection found new timestamped traces during
the final tests under `PrepareEvidencePipeline`, `TokenSplitter`, `ModelCliLLM`
and `ReadSlideTool`; the last two component directories were newly created.
`cache-audit.json` records the observed scope without reading trace contents.
No further runtime tests or cache cleanup followed in that checkpoint. There is
no pre-run snapshot of this cache, so this report does **not** claim that all
pre-existing runtime/cache contents were untouched. A Windows isolation fix
and proof of effective storage paths motivated the follow-up below.

## Historical R0 failure classification and changes

Public surfaces affected by the two bug fixes are QASPER candidate evidence
projection and retrieval-query context. CLI signatures, prompt templates, route
selection, numeric algorithms, authorization, schemas, metrics and runtime
directory isolation rules were not changed.

| Original failure                                                                  | Classification, authoritative contract and repair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_required_slots_bind_semantically_to_final_selected_evidence`                | Outdated fixture. The physical-evidence identity rule introduced in `dd7f41ea` forbids reusing one physical identity for two required operands. The fixture now supplies two distinct selected spans on the same final page, each worth 4.2; it still tests rebinding from the preliminary page. `test_required_operand_slots_cannot_reuse_one_physical_evidence_identity` is retained unchanged.                            |
| `test_qasper_candidate_prompt_binds_typed_proposition_and_required_evidence_refs` | Implementation defect at the merge of canonical selector materialization (`dff0a8f0`) and cross-record contributions (`66e4912d`). A contribution ref could lack a canonical selector. Keep local plans and ordering; obtain missing selectors only when admitted by the joint canonical evidence universe. Added positive cross-record, orphan-rejection and missing-map fail-closed regressions. No raw-selector fallback. |
| `test_candidate_packing_prioritizes_relation_and_quantifier_over_record_id`       | Outdated expectation. Existing verifier priority (`256339a0`) sorts polarity before preferred IDs; candidate priority sorts relation/quantifier first. Fixed full expected order for both modes, preserving preferred-ID priority within equal polarity. Production ordering is unchanged.                                                                                                                                   |
| Two producer/runtime receipt tests in `test_fullsystem_runtime_barrier.py`        | Outdated fixtures: `benchmark-runtime` conflicts with the established `benchmark_*` basename rule. Changed only the two fixture basenames to `benchmark_runtime`; rejection and isolation tests remain. Native pytest skips these on Windows. A separate Git Bash check exercised the real producer and barrier, including invalid-basename rejection.                                                                       |
| `test_c9b8d385_true_unanswerable_recovery_uses_selected_document_title`           | Implementation defect: passive type questions receive a synthetic `define` predicate and lose required selected-paper context. Added a bounded generic type-question grammar; unknown actor, single selected/active document and title requirements remain. Added three positive, three explicit-relation/actor negative and two selection-negative cases. No case-ID branch.                                                |
| `test_docqa_contract_characterization.py` isort                                   | Import-order correction only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `qasper_answer_relation.py` codespell token anchor                                | The reported token is the actual result of `_stem("languages")`. Use that expression in the same anchor set, preserving stemming behavior; no global spelling exclusion or literal replacement with a different token.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Historical [quality run 33939529781](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/33939529781)
was read live. Its coverage job failed at **3 failed / 1,523 passed** in the
benchmark test stage, before any coverage-floor report. A threshold violation
was not established by that log (`coverage-ci-excerpt.txt`).

The first candidate repair used joint plan priorities globally. The complete
ktem suite exposed a regression in the frozen eight-record stage-2 fixture
(required `E7:S14` disappeared). That version was not accepted: the final
repair retains per-record priorities and uses joint evidence only for missing
canonical contributions. Its in-progress coverage-script run was interrupted
at 47%; that run is neither a complete suite nor coverage evidence for the
final revision.

Cross-record cases now require an additional canonical preparation only when
local refs lack materialized selectors. The candidate transaction is passed
through; provider latency and benchmark throughput have not been measured.

Complete package and coverage results are recorded in the review completion
below.

Remaining platform blockers include missing secure `dir_fd`/`O_DIRECTORY`/
`O_NOFOLLOW` operations and `fchmod`, Windows symlink privileges, unavailable
FIFO, POSIX filename/path/mode assumptions, open-file replacement semantics,
and byte-for-byte vendor-license checks affected by CRLF checkout. These are
not repaired by weakening security checks, changing expected failures or
normalizing vendored licenses. Full Ubuntu package/coverage gates still need
an existing suitable environment or a separately authorized setup change.

Not executed: clean wheel install, container builds/runs, desktop Gate 2,
browser malicious-content smoke, dependency-vulnerability/secret scans,
provider/model probes, Slurm jobs and benchmark dataset runs. No network
model call was intentionally initiated. Package unit tests do not establish
benchmark artifact completeness or end-to-end UI readiness.

## Historical tracked repository map

Inventory reads `git ls-tree` and blobs at the Dev base, not the working tree's
runtime directories. `repository-map.json` records every tracked path with its
role/area, Python imports and exports, dynamic-entry candidates, JS import
edges and static components. `inventory.py` and `inventory-summary.json` in
the evidence directory reproduce the measurements.

Measured: **2,436 tracked files**, **1,818 Python modules parsed** (zero parse
errors), including **1,129 production Python modules**. There are **5,437
explicit internal Python edges**, **8,604 with parent-package initialization
edges**, and **24 production static strongly connected components** (largest
sizes 237, 32, 15, 15). Lazy/conditional imports are included: these are
inspection candidates, not proof that all such cycles execute at runtime.
JS scanning resolved 209 internal import occurrences; 160 external/unresolved
specifiers remain explicit. Dynamic candidates total 1,498: 744 calls,
383 event bindings and 371 classpath/patch strings, followed by manual seam
inspection. These counts are not counts of independent public APIs.

The separate frontend inventory records 1,306 occurrences: 95 literal element
IDs, 29 class declarations, 203 DOM selector calls and 979 CSS rule candidates.
Computed selectors and template interpolation are not statically resolved;
these are source locations for review, not a browser-execution proof.

Vendored PDF.js archive/license/manifest and two LaTeX resource files retain licenses. Binary payloads, virtual environments, caches and user datasets were not traversed for code analysis.                                                                                                       |

The third-party `assets/js/svg-pan-zoom.min.js` (v3.6.2, with its upstream
header) is also classified as vendor and excluded from owned-source analysis.

Disjoint role totals: 1,183 source, 722 test, 309 docs/platform, 105
config/delivery, 31 auxiliary-history, 16 generated-artifact, 5 generated-lock,
19 asset, 1 generated-source, 39 fixture/resource and 6 vendor files.

Manual boundaries needing preservation:

- Click `_LazyDocQAGroup` / `_LazyKotaemonGroup` defer loading command modules.
  `kotaemon.agents.__init__` currently has eager exports despite the hygiene
  contract's lazy-load wording; this discrepancy needs separate characterization.
- Gradio `.then` and event input/output order, component attributes, cancellation
  and streaming are behavior. Patch strings in tests and classpaths in config
  remain consumers even when a static import appears unused.
- `chat_message_events.py` orders submit, runtime stream, request cache,
  selection clearing, PDF refresh, scroll, conversation naming, then non-demo
  persistence; `.success` and `.then` have distinct failure behavior.
- `chat_panel.py` creates `main-pdf-preview`, its iframe/shell and `chat-input`;
  `assets/js/main.js` queries those IDs/classes and `assets/css/main.css`
  styles them. `chat_layout.py` creates `chat-info-panel` / `html-info-panel`,
  which `pdf_viewer.js` reads during modal and scrolling actions. Renames need
  all producers/consumers and packaging reviewed together.
- `ktem.db.models` resolves `KH_TABLE_*` dynamically and may initialize tables.
  Conversation `data_source` JSON, user/public fields and `Settings.setting`
  are persisted contracts. `IndexManager` resolves `KH_INDEX_TYPES`; default
  settings load model/loader extensions. No migrations were made.
- `libs/ktem/MANIFEST.in` owns JS/CSS/icons/PDF.js resources. Frontend DOM/CSS
  selectors and loading order require browser verification, not just an import
  graph. Platform-support registry/specs own `.codex` / `.claude` resources.
- `kotaemon` upward dependencies include explicit app-init/CLI/request-adapter
  seams, plus citation-QA and Cohere-ranking application coupling. A blanket
  ban would break existing integrations; inspect each seam before moving it.

## Historical R1 location planning

R1 remains unexecuted; **zero duplicate implementations or internal dependency
edges were removed in this batch**. Both old modules and the `DocQARuntime` /
`ChatPage` staticmethod/patch paths are unchanged. A suitable future neutral
location is `libs/ktem/ktem_contracts/file_selection.py`: its parent currently
contains only a package docstring and `ktem_contracts*` is included in packaging.
Importing a module under `ktem.docqa` or `ktem.utils` would invoke heavier parents.

Callers include runtime session/turn/mutation services, `ChatPage` and chat
knowledge-graph runtime. Preserve old exports/signatures and test
`test_chat_source_scope`, `test_docqa_runtime_helpers`, runtime callers and
isolated cold imports. Before extraction, fixed-expectation tests must cover
None/empty/scalar/list/tuple, duplicates, whitespace, 0/False, order, exceptions
and input immutability: normalize preserves repetitions/whitespace and
stringifies 0/False; merge strips/deduplicates and discards 0/False. Keep UI
selector adaptation and the separate `chat_submit_sources` helper out of R1.

Priority after restoring the gates: R1 pure selection duplication (small,
bounded benefit); R2 parent-package and runtime composition boundaries (high
import/lifecycle risk); R3 one Web event workflow at a time (event-order risk);
R4 one planning/evidence/execution rule boundary (very high semantic risk);
R5 one storage/index/graph/session/artifact lifecycle (authorization/data risk);
R6 CLI/desktop/benchmark/delivery cleanup with package/resource compatibility.
No later phase is authorized by this report. Each needs its own characterization,
package gate, actual diff review and independent acceptance.

## Historical original R0 review completion

The changed-file set is limited to:

- Production: `libs/ktem/ktem/docqa/qasper_answer_relation.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem/docqa/typed_retrieval_recovery.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/mara_qasper_candidate_selector_projection.py`.
- Existing tests: `benchmark/tests/test_fullsystem_runtime_barrier.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_calculation_plan.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_contract_characterization.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_mara_qasper_candidate_input_priority.py`.
- Added files: `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_generic_recovery_context.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_qasper_cross_record_selector_projection.py`,
  and this document.

At the user's request, the repairs were committed locally on
`codex/r0-r1-safe-refactor`, above the unchanged audit base
`adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a`:

- `1651eed2`: canonical cross-record selector repair and regressions.
- `60a311de`: generic type-question recovery context and regressions.
- `bd75fe1d`: evidence, priority and runtime-receipt fixture corrections.
- `dacca8b1`: import-order and semantics-preserving spelling fixes.

The reviewed implementation checkpoint is `dacca8b1`; this record is delivered
in a following documentation commit. Each staged diff passed
`git diff --cached --check`. Committing does not change the R0 NO-GO decision.
At that commit-preparation checkpoint, no push or merge had occurred and no
additional runtime tests were run. The user subsequently requested and
authorized pushing the five original commits through `89d99551`; the follow-up
below does not push again.

To roll back the implementation while preserving history, revert only these
four commits in reverse order:
`git revert dacca8b1 bd75fe1d 60a311de 1651eed2`.
The documentation commit may be reverted separately if desired. Check for
new work before any rollback; the pre-existing `NUL`, runtime data,
environment, other branches and worktrees are outside this batch.
No rollback has been executed.

Final complete suite results:

Package floors and the script's final reports were not reached.                                                                                |

The eleven benchmark/root failures are: five Windows symlink privilege cases;
two POSIX Bash launch cases (the bare `bash` resolves to the WindowsApps alias,
with GBK decoding warnings obscuring stderr); the POSIX `.venv/lib/python*/`
fingerprint assumption; missing `sha256sum` on PATH; the Windows cache-isolation
failure above; and the long-document fixture's byte preflight (4,510 checkout
bytes versus 4,471 bytes in the Git blob because of CRLF). The latter failed
before exercising the runtime recovery query; its assertion/fixture was not
weakened. The separate original-six and generic-recovery unit results remain
as listed above.

Final-revision coverage data from the completed ktem, CLI and benchmark/root
runs was combined with `coverage combine --keep`, preserving the original
data. Changed modules measure 88.60%, 96.33% and 98.95% respectively
(`r0-coverage-changed-modules.log`). The repository's
`calculate_diff_coverage` evaluator, supplied the **then-uncommitted diff**
against the Dev base, reported **100.00% (17/17 changed production statements)**
at the unchanged 90% minimum (`r0-working-diff-coverage.log`). The ordinary
CLI compares committed HEADs, so the external `working_diff_coverage.py`
adapted diff collection for that measurement. Committing preserved the
measured source contents. This partial aggregate
is evidence for the repair lines, not a passed full coverage gate; the four
package floors remain unverified.

**Stop at independent R0 review.** Restoring supported-platform package gates,
resolving the timing failures and proving cache isolation come before R1.

## Historical R0 follow-up through 7496c6ae

The reviewed input HEAD is `89d99551a028ff4948bb40f0a06bcc24d24822cb`; the fixed
comparison base remains `adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a`.
All new evidence is under the original evidence directory's `followup/`.
`execution.jsonl` records the exact argv, cwd, exit code, duration, input HEAD
and SHA256 of every changed/new Python file for each run. `versions.json`
records CPython 3.10.19, pytest 8.4.2, coverage 7.10.7, pre-commit 4.3.0,
SQLAlchemy 2.0.43, theflow 0.8.6, platformdirs 4.4.0 and uv 0.11.19.
The command prefix is still `uv run --no-sync --offline --python 3.10 python`.
Unless stated otherwise, cwd is `D:\PythonProject\MARA`.
The final implementation HEAD is
`dffd695497a074895da72216ea8155874f016ffb`; the documentation commit follows it.
`head-*` execution records name this exact SHA with no uncommitted Python
changes. `source-equivalence.json` compares the earlier focused checks' file
hashes with this implementation, so their former input HEAD is not mistaken
for a test of unchanged `89d99551` source.

### Changes and public boundaries

- Test infrastructure: `pytest_runtime_isolation.py`, new
  `pytest_runtime_plugin.py`, root `conftest.py`, and the kotaemon/slide_cli
  `tests/conftest.py` files. All three entrypoints activate the same owned
  session before business imports. Tempfiles, inherited desktop settings,
  NLTK resources, actual storage settings and cleanup ownership are covered.
  Bundled NLTK resources are copied read-only into the session. SQLAlchemy
  pools and theflow caches are closed only for session-owned paths.
  Cleanup runs at pytest unconfigure so test results remain visible if a
  resource cannot close. A regression covers read-only owned Git fixtures;
  the narrow Windows unlink repair requires a regular, read-only file inside
  the owned root. Other cleanup errors are still raised.
- Necessary bootstrap changes: `ktem/runtime_bootstrap.py` and
  `ktem/default_flowsettings.py`. An explicit test flag selects owned
  config/data/cache paths and rejects external configured paths before I/O.
  Test configuration does not search source/user parents for `.env`.
  Without that flag, normal PlatformDirs and Desktop path selection remain;
  an explicitly configured NLTK directory is respected. No DB schema,
  provider record, CLI signature, UI event chain or production timeout changes.
- New protection tests: `tests/test_runtime_isolation_bootstrap.py`,
  `tests/test_runtime_isolation_subprocess.py` and
  `tests/test_runtime_isolation_entrypoints.py`. They check actual SQLite,
  storage traces, files/output writes, child/grandchild inheritance, both
  initialization orders, early rejection and ownership-aware cleanup.
  Package-cwd probes execute their real conftest entrypoints. The source
  bootstrap path is asserted against this checkout.
- Existing fixture corrections: `test_preview_cache_roots.py` temporarily sets
  `USERPROFILE` as well as `HOME`; `test_workspace_flowsettings_storage.py`
  explicitly activates its child runtime and checks its resolved storage root.
  Both retain their behavioral assertions.
- Confirmed Windows security defects: `ktem/index/file/deletion.py`,
  `ktem/index/file/storage_lifetime.py` and `ktem/preview/service.py` now reject
  path anchors, including rooted paths without a drive, before joining them
  to trusted storage. Existing deletion/preview/storage negative cases cover
  the failure. The preview test also blocks external mkdir if rejection ever
  regresses; the storage test requires the intended typed error. POSIX
  descriptor, symlink, identity, atomic publication and vendor checks remain.
- Deadline tests: `test_docqa_route_deadline.py`, `test_mara_route_deadline.py`
  and new `route_deadline_test_helpers.py`. Only the two wall-clock unit tests
  use a controlled unresponsive worker/clock. Their state/evidence assertions
  remain, with explicit waits of 0.08s and 0.10s and one worker start. All six
  real timeout/cancellation integration tests remain unchanged.

The deadline implementation reserves 20ms from the 100ms test request, then
allows an additional 100ms cancellation grace. The old `<0.2s` assertion had
little room for scheduling and clock granularity. `observe_deadline.py`
recorded waits of 0.08478s and 0.10849s; elapsed perf-counter time was 0.19752s
while the production monotonic trace reported 0.204s. That diagnostic exited
1 because the then-open SQLite pool prevented cleanup; its timing observation
is not a passed gate. The deterministic tests do not assert that an
unresponsive backend physically stops within the nominal request budget.
Real integration tests separately check cancellation once, cooperative stop,
late-result rejection, no late evidence/authority, and unchanged defaults.

### Isolation incident and retained evidence

The first package-cwd attempts in this follow-up did not load root conftest.
Consequently their apparent test passes were insufficient isolation evidence.
The unisolated kotaemon run updated the actual profile's `.env`, `.env.example`
and `flowsettings.py` at 09:03:35, and cache metadata contains 335 entries
updated since follow-up start. This is a validation error in this follow-up;
it is not attributed only to the previous R0 run.

`known-runtime-metadata.json` and `user-cache-before-final.json` record observed
metadata without exposing configuration contents. The known profile and
repository SQLite files retain August modification times. There is no complete
pre-run snapshot, so neither original configuration contents nor every runtime
byte can be certified unchanged. No verified pre-run config backup was found
in the profile directory. Observed config files were preserved separately in
`config-observed-after-package-run/`; that is an after-event copy, not a
restoration source. No user cache/config was deleted, moved or guessed back.

After adding package entrypoint activation, the controlled 42-test run and CLI
suite produced zero metadata changes against the retained user-cache,
office-cache and canonical NLTK snapshot. The final focused check adds the
read-only cleanup case for 43 passes. `user-cache-after-final.json` and
`final-runtime-footprint.json` record the post-suite comparison, including
config bytes against the retained after-event copy. The final comparison finds
zero added/changed/removed cache entries, identical retained config bytes,
unchanged observed SQLite metadata and no remaining coverage bootstrap files.
These comparisons cannot
recover or certify the original pre-run state. The first ktem and coverage
attempts were interrupted when additional isolation gaps were discovered;
their logs remain and are not counted as completed gates.

Coverage instrumentation also wrote temporary `subcover_<pid>.pth` files in
the canonical `.venv` and its `Lib/site-packages`. The installed coverage
7.10.7 `patch=subprocess` implementation creates these files itself; disabling
bytecode writes does not prevent them. Two interrupted task-owned coverage
processes left four such files. Their process IDs, timestamps and exact
coverage bootstrap bytes established ownership; copies and the removal
record are in `coverage-bootstrap-cleanup/`. Only those four owned files were
removed. Local full coverage was not retried after discovering this behavior,
because it conflicts with the required canonical-environment write boundary.
No dependency installation, synchronization or upgrade was performed.

The first final-HEAD benchmark/root run exposed one new invocation problem:
the evidence-directory prefix made an atomic cache temporary path exceed this
Windows runtime's path limit. Only `MARA_PYTEST_RUNTIME_PARENT` was shortened
to `D:\MARA-r0-pytest-01a086ff`; every session still uses a unique ownership
marker and the same isolation plugin. The failing diagnostics case passed
under that parent (`head-root-short-path-regression.log`, exit 0, 1 passed).
Source, cache naming, fixture bytes and assertions were not changed.

### Historical failures and current gates

`historical-failure-nodes.json` maps all 118 failures from the three original
final suite logs to exact node IDs, log line ranges, error excerpts and reasons:
3 production/infrastructure defects, 2 test-clock/synchronization failures,
79 platform-capability or platform-semantics cases, 29 permission/tool failures,
2 CRLF/fixture-byte differences and 3 unconfirmed causes. The vendor LICENSE
and frozen QASPER document byte assertions remain unchanged.

The unconfirmed nodes are the equal-length rewrite download test, the two-fresh
DocQA POSIX launcher test, and the documented secret-file-permission shell
test. A likely platform mechanism is documented where supported; their
underlying failures are not relabeled as confirmed without adequate evidence.

| Current-source check                                                           | Result and log in `followup/`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actual isolation, subprocess/entrypoint and compatibility regressions          | Exit 0, 43 passed; `r0-cleanup-and-entrypoints-final.log`. Includes read-only fixture cleanup and default production-path compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Windows root/path security regressions                                         | Exit 0, 6 passed; `windows-root-paths-after.log`. The protected pre-fix run failed 3 cases. The same nodes pass in the final complete ktem suite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Original six, recovery/selector negatives and deadline/cancellation cases      | Exit 0, 27 passed / 2 POSIX skips; `r0-original-and-negative-final.log`. Source hashes distinguish later test-cleanup changes; the same executed nodes pass in the final full suites. Receipt skips still require real Linux execution.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-m pytest -q`, cwd `libs/slide_cli`                                           | Exit 0, 131 passed; `head-slide-cli-full.log`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `-m pytest -q libs/ktem/ktem_tests`                                            | Exit 1, 2,547 passed / 97 failed in 307.73s; `head-ktem-full.log`. Five historical failures resolved. Frozen stage-2, transaction and security-negative assertions were retained.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `-m pytest -q`, cwd `libs/kotaemon`                                            | Exit 1, 359 passed / 4 failed / 15 skipped in 113.09s; `head-kotaemon-full.log`. Four failures concern FIFO/symlink capability or permission. After the summary, unconfigure also raises WinError 32 for the Chroma/HNSW `data_level0.bin` held open on Windows.                                                                                                                          |
| `-m pytest -q benchmark/tests tests`                                           | The first final-HEAD run returned exit 1, 1,517 passed / 11 failed / 27 skipped in 387.52s; `head-root-benchmark-full.log`. Ten historical failures remain and one long test-root path failure was introduced by the invocation. With the shorter owned parent, exit 1, 1,518 passed / 10 failed / 27 skipped in 367.52s; `head-root-benchmark-short.log`. No new failed node IDs remain. |
| Full `scripts/run_coverage_gates.py --output-dir <followup>/coverage-isolated` | Intermediate source only, exit 1: first suite reached 100% but read-only owned fixture cleanup failed before the usual summary; `r0-isolated-coverage-complete.log`. That cleanup is now covered and fixed. No current-HEAD full coverage run followed discovery of coverage's canonical-environment `.pth` writes. No package floor was reached.                                         |
| Full Ruff, hygiene, baseline against exact Dev SHA                             | Exit 0; `head-ruff.log`, `head-hygiene.log`, `head-baseline.log`. Baseline was not refreshed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Changed-file pre-commit and final diff whitespace checks                       | Python source checks passed with exit 0 in `r0-final-static-pass.log` (all 20 Python file hashes match final implementation). Final report pre-commit and `git diff --check` also pass with exit 0; `head-report-static-pass.log` and the staged commit record.                                                                                                                           |

`head-suite-comparison.json` contains exact final failed node IDs, resolutions
and category counts against the original three complete logs: seven historical
failures resolved, 111 remain, and no new failed node IDs. All four package
coverage floors remain required: benchmark 90%, slide_cli 70%, kotaemon 60%
and ktem 50%. No changed-lines result substitutes for these floors.

The bounded read-only Barkla SSH retry still fails with
`Control socket connect(...codex-jump-relay-lxe): Connection refused` (exit 1).
No WSL distribution or suitable local Linux/container runtime is available.
The work-branch CI query found no runs. Its remote HEAD is the earlier
`89d99551`; follow-up source has not been pushed, so dispatching that old
revision would not validate these changes. `environment-blockers.json`
records the exact branch/base, command and missing execution/synchronization
conditions. No old CI result substitutes for the current source, and no new
environment was installed or synchronized.

**R0 NO-GO; R1 not started.** Complete supported-platform suites, both POSIX
receipt executions, package coverage floors and the remaining diagnostic/
cleanup issues are still outstanding. No characterization/extraction into
`ktem_contracts.file_selection` has begun. Stop here without R2.

Four new local implementation commits retain the five reviewed commits:

- `c6032903`: runtime entrypoint/ownership and path-boundary protection tests.
- `0e49aea1`: test isolation, bootstrap boundaries and fixture corrections.
- `c08cc1bc`: reject anchored paths before storage operations.
- `dffd6954`: deterministic deadline unit checks and shared test helper.

This existing report is delivered in a separate fifth local documentation
commit. `final-git-state.json` records its actual full HEAD, status, branch,
commit range and remote comparison. Each staged diff passes
`git diff --cached --check`; the pre-existing untracked `NUL` remains.
No follow-up push, PR, merge, branch/worktree creation, branch switch, reset,
clean or history rewrite was performed.

For a history-preserving implementation rollback, review later work first and
revert only `dffd6954 c08cc1bc 0e49aea1 c6032903` in that order. The documentation
commit is separate. This does not revert the five earlier commits or restore
external profile/cache contents. No rollback was executed.
