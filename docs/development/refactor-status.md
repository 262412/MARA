# MARA refactor status — 2026-09-10

## Decision and protected baseline

**R0 remains NO-GO; R1 has not started.** The follow-up below repairs test
isolation, deterministic deadline checks and two confirmed Windows path-boundary
defects. Current supported-platform package and coverage gates remain required.
Skipped POSIX tests and historical CI are not current passes. The five earlier
R0 commits, through `89d99551a028ff4948bb40f0a06bcc24d24822cb`, were pushed at the
user's explicit request before this follow-up. This follow-up permits local
commits only and performs no new push, branch/worktree creation, branch switch,
merge, history rewrite, environment synchronization or R1/R2 extraction.

- Reviewed and fetched `origin/Dev`:
  `adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a` (the supplied audit base).
- Work branch: `codex/r0-r1-safe-refactor`, created from that Dev commit.
- Initial checkout: `main` at `412568ed41bfc92a7d11829b464e788065c7ac85`;
  existing local `Dev` remains `bc8074d0f724a3a1005a2637f4a1e867f56d68de`.
- Initial tracked changes: none. The existing untracked `NUL` and other
  worktrees were preserved. Runtime data and the existing `.venv` were retained.
- Evidence directory (outside Git):
  `D:\PythonProject\MARA-refactor-review-20260910-01a086ff`.
  `execution.jsonl` records wrapper commands, cwd, exit codes, duration and log
  paths; the other named logs retain direct-command and baseline evidence.

The primary checkout has an existing Windows CPython 3.10.19 environment.
The POSIX canonical wrapper requires `bin/python` and HPC mount paths that
are absent here; WSL reported no installed distribution. Tests used
`uv run --no-sync --offline --python 3.10 python`, with the three current
workspace libraries on `PYTHONPATH`, existing cached pre-commit environments,
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, and a session `MARA_PYTEST_RUNTIME_PARENT` under
the evidence directory. No syncing/installing wrapper was substituted.
This is Windows source validation, not a claim of Ubuntu CI equivalence.

**Historical isolation exception from the original R0 full suite:** `PlatformDirs` on Windows
does not use the test's XDG cache override. `flowsettings.STORAGE["prefix"]`
resolved to the existing
`C:\Users\22826\AppData\Local\Cinnamon\Kotaemon\Cache\theflow`, outside the
session directory. Metadata inspection found new timestamped traces during
the final tests under `PrepareEvidencePipeline`, `TokenSplitter`, `ModelCliLLM`
and `ReadSlideTool`; the last two component directories were newly created.
`cache-audit.json` records the observed scope without reading trace contents.
No further runtime tests or cache cleanup followed in that checkpoint. There is
no pre-run snapshot of this cache, so this report does **not** claim that all
pre-existing runtime/cache contents were untouched. A Windows isolation fix
and proof of effective storage paths motivated the follow-up below.

## R0 failure classification and changes

Public surfaces affected by the two bug fixes are QASPER candidate evidence
projection and retrieval-query context. CLI signatures, prompt templates, route
selection, numeric algorithms, authorization, schemas, metrics and runtime
directory isolation rules were not changed.

| Original failure                                                                  | Classification, authoritative contract and repair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_required_slots_bind_semantically_to_final_selected_evidence`                | Outdated fixture. The physical-evidence identity rule introduced in `dd7f41ea` forbids reusing one physical identity for two required operands. The fixture now supplies two distinct selected spans on the same final page, each worth 4.2; it still tests rebinding from the preliminary page. `test_required_operand_slots_cannot_reuse_one_physical_evidence_identity` is retained unchanged.                            |
| `test_qasper_candidate_prompt_binds_typed_proposition_and_required_evidence_refs` | Implementation defect at the merge of canonical selector materialization (`dff0a8f0`) and cross-record contributions (`66e4912d`). A contribution ref could lack a canonical selector. Keep local plans and ordering; obtain missing selectors only when admitted by the joint canonical evidence universe. Added positive cross-record, orphan-rejection and missing-map fail-closed regressions. No raw-selector fallback. |
| `test_candidate_packing_prioritizes_relation_and_quantifier_over_record_id`       | Outdated expectation. Existing verifier priority (`256339a0`) sorts polarity before preferred IDs; candidate priority sorts relation/quantifier first. Fixed full expected order for both modes, preserving preferred-ID priority within equal polarity. Production ordering is unchanged.                                                                                                                                   |
| Two producer/runtime receipt tests in `test_fullsystem_runtime_barrier.py`        | Outdated fixtures: `benchmark-runtime` conflicts with the established `benchmark_*` basename rule. Changed only the two fixture basenames to `benchmark_runtime`; rejection and isolation tests remain. Native pytest skips these on Windows. A separate Git Bash check exercised the real producer and barrier, including invalid-basename rejection.                                                                       |
| `test_c9b8d385_true_unanswerable_recovery_uses_selected_document_title`           | Implementation defect: passive type questions receive a synthetic `define` predicate and lose required selected-paper context. Added a bounded generic type-question grammar; unknown actor, single selected/active document and title requirements remain. Added three positive, three explicit-relation/actor negative and two selection-negative cases. No case-ID branch.                                                |
| `test_docqa_contract_characterization.py` isort                                   | Import-order correction only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `qasper_answer_relation.py` codespell token anchor                                | The reported token is the actual result of `_stem("languages")`. Use that expression in the same anchor set, preserving stemming behavior; no global spelling exclusion or literal replacement with a different token.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Historical [quality run 33939529781](https://github.com/262412/MARA/actions/runs/33939529781)
was read live. Its coverage job failed at **3 failed / 1,523 passed** in the
benchmark test stage, before any coverage-floor report. A threshold violation
was not established by that log (`coverage-ci-excerpt.txt`).

The first candidate repair used joint plan priorities globally. The complete
ktem suite exposed a regression in the frozen eight-record stage-2 fixture
(required `E7:S14` disappeared). That version was not accepted: the final
repair retains per-record priorities and uses joint evidence only for missing
canonical contributions. Its in-progress coverage-script run was interrupted
at 47%; that run is neither a complete suite nor coverage evidence for the
final revision.

Cross-record cases now require an additional canonical preparation only when
local refs lack materialized selectors. The candidate transaction is passed
through; provider latency and benchmark throughput have not been measured.

## Verification evidence

All Python rows below use the common no-sync command above. Unless specified,
cwd is `D:\PythonProject\MARA`. The PowerShell evidence `run.ps1` supplies only
the environment and logging described above. Full logs, including failed
intermediate runs, are retained rather than overwritten.

Complete package and coverage results are recorded in the review completion
below.

Remaining platform blockers include missing secure `dir_fd`/`O_DIRECTORY`/
`O_NOFOLLOW` operations and `fchmod`, Windows symlink privileges, unavailable
FIFO, POSIX filename/path/mode assumptions, open-file replacement semantics,
and byte-for-byte vendor-license checks affected by CRLF checkout. These are
not repaired by weakening security checks, changing expected failures or
normalizing vendored licenses. Full Ubuntu package/coverage gates still need
an existing suitable environment or a separately authorized setup change.

Not executed: clean wheel install, container builds/runs, desktop Gate 2,
browser malicious-content smoke, dependency-vulnerability/secret scans,
provider/model probes, Slurm jobs and benchmark dataset runs. No network
model call was intentionally initiated. Package unit tests do not establish
benchmark artifact completeness or end-to-end UI readiness.

## Tracked repository map

Inventory reads `git ls-tree` and blobs at the Dev base, not the working tree's
runtime directories. `repository-map.json` records every tracked path with its
role/area, Python imports and exports, dynamic-entry candidates, JS import
edges and static components. `inventory.py` and `inventory-summary.json` in
the evidence directory reproduce the measurements.

Measured: **2,436 tracked files**, **1,818 Python modules parsed** (zero parse
errors), including **1,129 production Python modules**. There are **5,437
explicit internal Python edges**, **8,604 with parent-package initialization
edges**, and **24 production static strongly connected components** (largest
sizes 237, 32, 15, 15). Lazy/conditional imports are included: these are
inspection candidates, not proof that all such cycles execute at runtime.
JS scanning resolved 209 internal import occurrences; 160 external/unresolved
specifiers remain explicit. Dynamic candidates total 1,498: 744 calls,
383 event bindings and 371 classpath/patch strings, followed by manual seam
inspection. These counts are not counts of independent public APIs.

The separate frontend inventory records 1,306 occurrences: 95 literal element
IDs, 29 class declarations, 203 DOM selector calls and 979 CSS rule candidates.
Computed selectors and template interpolation are not statically resolved;
these are source locations for review, not a browser-execution proof.

The third-party `assets/js/svg-pan-zoom.min.js` (v3.6.2, with its upstream
header) is also classified as vendor and excluded from owned-source analysis.

Disjoint role totals: 1,183 source, 722 test, 309 docs/platform, 105
config/delivery, 31 auxiliary-history, 16 generated-artifact, 5 generated-lock,
19 asset, 1 generated-source, 39 fixture/resource and 6 vendor files.

Manual boundaries needing preservation:

- Click `_LazyDocQAGroup` / `_LazyKotaemonGroup` defer loading command modules.
  `kotaemon.agents.__init__` currently has eager exports despite the hygiene
  contract's lazy-load wording; this discrepancy needs separate characterization.
- Gradio `.then` and event input/output order, component attributes, cancellation
  and streaming are behavior. Patch strings in tests and classpaths in config
  remain consumers even when a static import appears unused.
- `chat_message_events.py` orders submit, runtime stream, request cache,
  selection clearing, PDF refresh, scroll, conversation naming, then non-demo
  persistence; `.success` and `.then` have distinct failure behavior.
- `chat_panel.py` creates `main-pdf-preview`, its iframe/shell and `chat-input`;
  `assets/js/main.js` queries those IDs/classes and `assets/css/main.css`
  styles them. `chat_layout.py` creates `chat-info-panel` / `html-info-panel`,
  which `pdf_viewer.js` reads during modal and scrolling actions. Renames need
  all producers/consumers and packaging reviewed together.
- `ktem.db.models` resolves `KH_TABLE_*` dynamically and may initialize tables.
  Conversation `data_source` JSON, user/public fields and `Settings.setting`
  are persisted contracts. `IndexManager` resolves `KH_INDEX_TYPES`; default
  settings load model/loader extensions. No migrations were made.
- `libs/ktem/MANIFEST.in` owns JS/CSS/icons/PDF.js resources. Frontend DOM/CSS
  selectors and loading order require browser verification, not just an import
  graph. Platform-support registry/specs own `.codex` / `.claude` resources.
- `kotaemon` upward dependencies include explicit app-init/CLI/request-adapter
  seams, plus citation-QA and Cohere-ranking application coupling. A blanket
  ban would break existing integrations; inspect each seam before moving it.

## R1 location and later batches

R1 remains unexecuted; **zero duplicate implementations or internal dependency
edges were removed in this batch**. Both old modules and the `DocQARuntime` /
`ChatPage` staticmethod/patch paths are unchanged. A suitable future neutral
location is `libs/ktem/ktem_contracts/file_selection.py`: its parent currently
contains only a package docstring and `ktem_contracts*` is included in packaging.
Importing a module under `ktem.docqa` or `ktem.utils` would invoke heavier parents.

Callers include runtime session/turn/mutation services, `ChatPage` and chat
knowledge-graph runtime. Preserve old exports/signatures and test
`test_chat_source_scope`, `test_docqa_runtime_helpers`, runtime callers and
isolated cold imports. Before extraction, fixed-expectation tests must cover
None/empty/scalar/list/tuple, duplicates, whitespace, 0/False, order, exceptions
and input immutability: normalize preserves repetitions/whitespace and
stringifies 0/False; merge strips/deduplicates and discards 0/False. Keep UI
selector adaptation and the separate `chat_submit_sources` helper out of R1.

Priority after restoring the gates: R1 pure selection duplication (small,
bounded benefit); R2 parent-package and runtime composition boundaries (high
import/lifecycle risk); R3 one Web event workflow at a time (event-order risk);
R4 one planning/evidence/execution rule boundary (very high semantic risk);
R5 one storage/index/graph/session/artifact lifecycle (authorization/data risk);
R6 CLI/desktop/benchmark/delivery cleanup with package/resource compatibility.
No later phase is authorized by this report. Each needs its own characterization,
package gate, actual diff review and independent acceptance.

## Original R0 review completion

The changed-file set is limited to:

- Production: `libs/ktem/ktem/docqa/qasper_answer_relation.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem/docqa/typed_retrieval_recovery.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/mara_qasper_candidate_selector_projection.py`.
- Existing tests: `benchmark/tests/test_fullsystem_runtime_barrier.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_calculation_plan.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_contract_characterization.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_mara_qasper_candidate_input_priority.py`.
- Added files: `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_docqa_generic_recovery_context.py`,
  `libs/ktem/ktem_tests/test_qasper_cross_record_selector_projection.py`,
  and this document.

At the user's request, the repairs were committed locally on
`codex/r0-r1-safe-refactor`, above the unchanged audit base
`adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a`:

- `1651eed2`: canonical cross-record selector repair and regressions.
- `60a311de`: generic type-question recovery context and regressions.
- `bd75fe1d`: evidence, priority and runtime-receipt fixture corrections.
- `dacca8b1`: import-order and semantics-preserving spelling fixes.

The reviewed implementation checkpoint is `dacca8b1`; this record is delivered
in a following documentation commit. Each staged diff passed
`git diff --cached --check`. Committing does not change the R0 NO-GO decision.
At that commit-preparation checkpoint, no push or merge had occurred and no
additional runtime tests were run. The user subsequently requested and
authorized pushing the five original commits through `89d99551`; the follow-up
below does not push again.

To roll back the implementation while preserving history, revert only these
four commits in reverse order:
`git revert dacca8b1 bd75fe1d 60a311de 1651eed2`.
The documentation commit may be reverted separately if desired. Check for
new work before any rollback; the pre-existing `NUL`, runtime data,
environment, other branches and worktrees are outside this batch.
No rollback has been executed.

The eleven benchmark/root failures are: five Windows symlink privilege cases;
two POSIX Bash launch cases (the bare `bash` resolves to the WindowsApps alias,
with GBK decoding warnings obscuring stderr); the POSIX `.venv/lib/python*/`
fingerprint assumption; missing `sha256sum` on PATH; the Windows cache-isolation
failure above; and the long-document fixture's byte preflight (4,510 checkout
bytes versus 4,471 bytes in the Git blob because of CRLF). The latter failed
before exercising the runtime recovery query; its assertion/fixture was not
weakened. The separate original-six and generic-recovery unit results remain
as listed above.

Final-revision coverage data from the completed ktem, CLI and benchmark/root
runs was combined with `coverage combine --keep`, preserving the original
data. Changed modules measure 88.60%, 96.33% and 98.95% respectively
(`r0-coverage-changed-modules.log`). The repository's
`calculate_diff_coverage` evaluator, supplied the **then-uncommitted diff**
against the Dev base, reported **100.00% (17/17 changed production statements)**
at the unchanged 90% minimum (`r0-working-diff-coverage.log`). The ordinary
CLI compares committed HEADs, so the external `working_diff_coverage.py`
adapted diff collection for that measurement. Committing preserved the
measured source contents. This partial aggregate
is evidence for the repair lines, not a passed full coverage gate; the four
package floors remain unverified.

**Stop at independent R0 review.** Restoring supported-platform package gates,
resolving the timing failures and proving cache isolation come before R1.

## R0 follow-up on the same branch

The reviewed input HEAD is `89d99551a028ff4948bb40f0a06bcc24d24822cb`; the fixed
comparison base remains `adab3f4d8f221e3620494fab0a24ef8e5557d12a`.
All new evidence is under the original evidence directory's `followup/`.
`execution.jsonl` records the exact argv, cwd, exit code, duration, input HEAD
and SHA256 of every changed/new Python file for each run. `versions.json`
records CPython 3.10.19, pytest 8.4.2, coverage 7.10.7, pre-commit 4.3.0,
SQLAlchemy 2.0.43, theflow 0.8.6, platformdirs 4.4.0 and uv 0.11.19.
The command prefix is still `uv run --no-sync --offline --python 3.10 python`.
Unless stated otherwise, cwd is `D:\PythonProject\MARA`.
The final implementation HEAD is
`dffd695497a074895da72216ea8155874f016ffb`; the documentation commit follows it.
`head-*` execution records name this exact SHA with no uncommitted Python
changes. `source-equivalence.json` compares the earlier focused checks' file
hashes with this implementation, so their former input HEAD is not mistaken
for a test of unchanged `89d99551` source.

### Changes and public boundaries

- Test infrastructure: `pytest_runtime_isolation.py`, new
  `pytest_runtime_plugin.py`, root `conftest.py`, and the kotaemon/slide_cli
  `tests/conftest.py` files. All three entrypoints activate the same owned
  session before business imports. Tempfiles, inherited desktop settings,
  NLTK resources, actual storage settings and cleanup ownership are covered.
  Bundled NLTK resources are copied read-only into the session. SQLAlchemy
  pools and theflow caches are closed only for session-owned paths.
  Cleanup runs at pytest unconfigure so test results remain visible if a
  resource cannot close. A regression covers read-only owned Git fixtures;
  the narrow Windows unlink repair requires a regular, read-only file inside
  the owned root. Other cleanup errors are still raised.
- Necessary bootstrap changes: `ktem/runtime_bootstrap.py` and
  `ktem/default_flowsettings.py`. An explicit test flag selects owned
  config/data/cache paths and rejects external configured paths before I/O.
  Test configuration does not search source/user parents for `.env`.
  Without that flag, normal PlatformDirs and Desktop path selection remain;
  an explicitly configured NLTK directory is respected. No DB schema,
  provider record, CLI signature, UI event chain or production timeout changes.
- New protection tests: `tests/test_runtime_isolation_bootstrap.py`,
  `tests/test_runtime_isolation_subprocess.py` and
  `tests/test_runtime_isolation_entrypoints.py`. They check actual SQLite,
  storage traces, files/output writes, child/grandchild inheritance, both
  initialization orders, early rejection and ownership-aware cleanup.
  Package-cwd probes execute their real conftest entrypoints. The source
  bootstrap path is asserted against this checkout.
- Existing fixture corrections: `test_preview_cache_roots.py` temporarily sets
  `USERPROFILE` as well as `HOME`; `test_workspace_flowsettings_storage.py`
  explicitly activates its child runtime and checks its resolved storage root.
  Both retain their behavioral assertions.
- Confirmed Windows security defects: `ktem/index/file/deletion.py`,
  `ktem/index/file/storage_lifetime.py` and `ktem/preview/service.py` now reject
  path anchors, including rooted paths without a drive, before joining them
  to trusted storage. Existing deletion/preview/storage negative cases cover
  the failure. The preview test also blocks external mkdir if rejection ever
  regresses; the storage test requires the intended typed error. POSIX
  descriptor, symlink, identity, atomic publication and vendor checks remain.
- Deadline tests: `test_docqa_route_deadline.py`, `test_mara_route_deadline.py`
  and new `route_deadline_test_helpers.py`. Only the two wall-clock unit tests
  use a controlled unresponsive worker/clock. Their state/evidence assertions
  remain, with explicit waits of 0.08s and 0.10s and one worker start. All six
  real timeout/cancellation integration tests remain unchanged.

The deadline implementation reserves 20ms from the 100ms test request, then
allows an additional 100ms cancellation grace. The old `<0.2s` assertion had
little room for scheduling and clock granularity. `observe_deadline.py`
recorded waits of 0.08478s and 0.10849s; elapsed perf-counter time was 0.19752s
while the production monotonic trace reported 0.204s. That diagnostic exited
1 because the then-open SQLite pool prevented cleanup; its timing observation
is not a passed gate. The deterministic tests do not assert that an
unresponsive backend physically stops within the nominal request budget.
Real integration tests separately check cancellation once, cooperative stop,
late-result rejection, no late evidence/authority, and unchanged defaults.

### Isolation incident and retained evidence

The first package-cwd attempts in this follow-up did not load root conftest.
Consequently their apparent test passes were insufficient isolation evidence.
The unisolated kotaemon run updated the actual profile's `.env`, `.env.example`
and `flowsettings.py` at 09:03:35, and cache metadata contains 335 entries
updated since follow-up start. This is a validation error in this follow-up;
it is not attributed only to the previous R0 run.

`known-runtime-metadata.json` and `user-cache-before-final.json` record observed
metadata without exposing configuration contents. The known profile and
repository SQLite files retain August modification times. There is no complete
pre-run snapshot, so neither original configuration contents nor every runtime
byte can be certified unchanged. No verified pre-run config backup was found
in the profile directory. Observed config files were preserved separately in
`config-observed-after-package-run/`; that is an after-event copy, not a
restoration source. No user cache/config was deleted, moved or guessed back.

After adding package entrypoint activation, the controlled 42-test run and CLI
suite produced zero metadata changes against the retained user-cache,
office-cache and canonical NLTK snapshot. The final focused check adds the
read-only cleanup case for 43 passes. `user-cache-after-final.json` and
`final-runtime-footprint.json` record the post-suite comparison, including
config bytes against the retained after-event copy. The final comparison finds
zero added/changed/removed cache entries, identical retained config bytes,
unchanged observed SQLite metadata and no remaining coverage bootstrap files.
These comparisons cannot
recover or certify the original pre-run state. The first ktem and coverage
attempts were interrupted when additional isolation gaps were discovered;
their logs remain and are not counted as completed gates.

Coverage instrumentation also wrote temporary `subcover_<pid>.pth` files in
the canonical `.venv` and its `Lib/site-packages`. The installed coverage
7.10.7 `patch=subprocess` implementation creates these files itself; disabling
bytecode writes does not prevent them. Two interrupted task-owned coverage
processes left four such files. Their process IDs, timestamps and exact
coverage bootstrap bytes established ownership; copies and the removal
record are in `coverage-bootstrap-cleanup/`. Only those four owned files were
removed. Local full coverage was not retried after discovering this behavior,
because it conflicts with the required canonical-environment write boundary.
No dependency installation, synchronization or upgrade was performed.

The first final-HEAD benchmark/root run exposed one new invocation problem:
the evidence-directory prefix made an atomic cache temporary path exceed this
Windows runtime's path limit. Only `MARA_PYTEST_RUNTIME_PARENT` was shortened
to `D:\MARA-r0-pytest-01a086ff`; every session still uses a unique ownership
marker and the same isolation plugin. The failing diagnostics case passed
under that parent (`head-root-short-path-regression.log`, exit 0, 1 passed).
Source, cache naming, fixture bytes and assertions were not changed.

### Historical failures and current gates

`historical-failure-nodes.json` maps all 118 failures from the three original
final suite logs to exact node IDs, log line ranges, error excerpts and reasons:
3 production/infrastructure defects, 2 test-clock/synchronization failures,
79 platform-capability or platform-semantics cases, 29 permission/tool failures,
2 CRLF/fixture-byte differences and 3 unconfirmed causes. The vendor LICENSE
and frozen QASPER document byte assertions remain unchanged.

The unconfirmed nodes are the equal-length rewrite download test, the two-fresh
DocQA POSIX launcher test, and the documented secret-file-permission shell
test. A likely platform mechanism is documented where supported; their
underlying failures are not relabeled as confirmed without adequate evidence.

`head-suite-comparison.json` contains exact final failed node IDs, resolutions
and category counts against the original three complete logs: seven historical
failures resolved, 111 remain, and no new failed node IDs. All four package
coverage floors remain required: benchmark 90%, slide_cli 70%, kotaemon 60%
and ktem 50%. No changed-lines result substitutes for these floors.

The bounded read-only Barkla SSH retry still fails with
`Control socket connect(...codex-jump-relay-lxe): Connection refused` (exit 1).
No WSL distribution or suitable local Linux/container runtime is available.
The work-branch CI query found no runs. Its remote HEAD is the earlier
`89d99551`; follow-up source has not been pushed, so dispatching that old
revision would not validate these changes. `environment-blockers.json`
records the exact branch/base, command and missing execution/synchronization
conditions. No old CI result substitutes for the current source, and no new
environment was installed or synchronized.

**R0 NO-GO; R1 not started.** Complete supported-platform suites, both POSIX
receipt executions, package coverage floors and the remaining diagnostic/
cleanup issues are still outstanding. No characterization/extraction into
`ktem_contracts.file_selection` has begun. Stop here without R2.

Four new local implementation commits retain the five reviewed commits:

- `c6032903`: runtime entrypoint/ownership and path-boundary protection tests.
- `0e49aea1`: test isolation, bootstrap boundaries and fixture corrections.
- `c08cc1bc`: reject anchored paths before storage operations.
- `dffd6954`: deterministic deadline unit checks and shared test helper.

This existing report is delivered in a separate fifth local documentation
commit. `final-git-state.json` records its actual full HEAD, status, branch,
commit range and remote comparison. Each staged diff passes
`git diff --cached --check`; the pre-existing untracked `NUL` remains.
No follow-up push, PR, merge, branch/worktree creation, branch switch, reset,
clean or history rewrite was performed.

For a history-preserving implementation rollback, review later work first and
revert only `dffd6954 c08cc1bc 0e49aea1 c6032903` in that order. The documentation
commit is separate. This does not revert the five earlier commits or restore
external profile/cache contents. No rollback was executed.
